# Rental and Tenant Management System - Property Plus

Property Plus is a real estate rental and tenant management system. It is a web application that allows two types of users to use the application. The two types of users are the owner and the tenant. The owner can post a property for rent, manage tenants, register rent payment, and create a property contract. The tenant can search and filter properties, view property details, send an email to the owner of the property, and use the built-in chat application for communication between the owner and the tenant.
